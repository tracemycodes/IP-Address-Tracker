# - IP address tracker

- An AI project displaying IP Address location of any valid searched IP address using the [IP Geolocation API by IPify](https://geo.ipify.org/). To generate the map i used [LeafletJS](https://leafletjs.com/) and MapBox for the dispay and interactivity.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, Mapbox, Leaflet, Ipify.

This application is designed to display the location of any device which accesses it and also pull out the Geo-location of any searched IP address.

users are able to:

- View the optimal layout for each page depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- See their own IP address on the map on the initial page load
- Search for any IP addresses or domains and see the key information and location

## Optimizations

_(optional)_

Future optimizations which can be included to this application includes but not limited to.

- Contributors can fork the repo and include further optimizations to this project

## Lessons Learned:

I learnt how to interact with the Leaflet and Mapbox Library accessing multiple API end points to achieve desired user experience.
